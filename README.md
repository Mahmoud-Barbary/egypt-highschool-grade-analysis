# Analyzing High School Students' Grades in Egypt

This project investigates the factors affecting student performance on the **Thanaweya Amma** national exam in Egypt, using a dataset of over 680,000 students from 2022. We explore trends across gender, region, and branch (Literature, Science, Math), and conduct hypothesis testing to evaluate whether performance in the Red Sea governorate differs from the national average.

## 📊 Key Features

- Exploratory data analysis using Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Regional heatmaps and violin plots for visual insights
- Gender and branch-based performance analysis
- Hypothesis testing using z-tests
- Real-world education dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohamedahmedx2/high-school-public-results-2022-eg)

## 🧪 Hypothesis Tested

> Is there a statistically significant difference between Red Sea students' scores and the national average?

✅ Result: Statistically significant differences were found across all branches.
